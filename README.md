Peer to Peer Shipping
Thanks for your interest in Voyago! Peer to peer shipping is here.

Voyago is super simple to use when compared to other shipping sites. Our team has compiled everything that goes into sending a package from one part of the world to the next. You can easily send a parcel with a few simple steps on our app and finding someone to deliver the goods. For the more ambitious of you, you're able to deliver customers packages with a smart-phone and of course our Voyago app. don't forget to dust that bike off or get your car ready.

The first step you want to do is ensure that you're not shipping anything illegal or prohibited. The airlines usually do a good job in telling you what we can and can't ship. Use their guidelines as an example.

The second step involves searching the map on the SEND tab within the Voyago app. This map shows all the active Voyago-ers (as we call them) who deliver packages. This can be a small local delivery user. Or a professional delivery user who travels internationally to drop stuff off.

The 3rd step involves checkout. When you have found someone click "MORE INFO" link (pop-up when clicking the green circle on the map). That links to the Voyago-ers personal checkout page and allows you to pay for services.

After payment you've reached step 4. You're package isn't ready for shipment until the Voyago-er knows where to drop it off. The QR code will be placed on your package by the Voyago-er (Don't tape over the QR Code). Be careful not to seal the parcel where the authorities can't open it.

On to step 5.. Drop your package to the Voyago-er. You can also pay a bit extra to have them pick-up.  It could delay shipping times.

That's all there is to it. Voyago makes it super simple to get your packages anywhere and fast. If you have tracking, you can view your shipment in real-time. Voyago is safe, secure, and most of all affordable.
